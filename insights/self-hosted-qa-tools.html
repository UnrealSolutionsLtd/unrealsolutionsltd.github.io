          <p>
            Most game studios default to cloud-based tools for bug tracking and QA. It's the easiest path: 
            sign up, create a project, start filing bugs. No servers to manage, no infrastructure to maintain.
          </p>
          <p>
            But there's a growing movement back toward self-hosted solutions. Not because cloud tools are bad, 
            but because for certain studios and certain projects, self-hosting is simply the better choice.
          </p>
          <p>
            This article explains when self-hosting makes sense, what the trade-offs are, and how to evaluate 
            whether it's right for your team.
          </p>

          <h2>What "Self-Hosted" Actually Means</h2>

          <p>
            Self-hosted QA tools run on infrastructure you control. That could mean:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Physical servers in your office</li>
            <li>Virtual machines in your private cloud</li>
            <li>Containers in your existing Kubernetes cluster</li>
            <li>A single server at a hosting provider, but one you manage</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The key distinction: your data stays on machines you control. Bug reports, video recordings, 
            screenshots, logs, and test results never leave your infrastructure.
          </p>

          <h2>When Self-Hosting Makes Sense</h2>

          <h3>1. NDA and Confidentiality Requirements</h3>
          <p>
            If you're working on a licensed IP, a console launch title, or any project with strict NDA requirements, 
            uploading bug reports to third-party servers may violate your agreements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Publishers often require that all project materials stay within controlled environments. Video evidence 
            of gameplay is particularly sensitive because it can reveal unannounced features, characters, or storylines.
          </p>

          <div class="callout">
            <p class="text-white font-semibold mb-2">Example scenario:</p>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-0">
              A studio working on a major franchise sequel. Their publisher agreement specifies that no gameplay 
              footage can be stored on third-party servers. A cloud QA tool that stores video uploads would 
              violate this requirement.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>2. Console Development</h3>
          <p>
            Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo have specific requirements about development kit footage and data. 
            Many console manufacturers require that devkit captures remain within secured environments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Self-hosted tools let you maintain compliance while still having a modern QA workflow.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Data Residency and Compliance</h3>
          <p>
            Some regions have strict data residency laws. If your studio or publisher requires that data 
            stay within specific geographic boundaries, you need infrastructure in those locations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Self-hosting gives you complete control over where your data physically resides.
          </p>

          <h3>4. Network Performance</h3>
          <p>
            Video files are large. A 30-second clip at 1080p can easily be 50-100MB. If your team is 
            uploading hundreds of bug reports per day, bandwidth to external servers becomes a bottleneck.
          </p>
          <p>
            Self-hosted tools on your local network transfer files at gigabit speeds. Uploads that took 
            minutes now take seconds.
          </p>

          <h3>5. Cost at Scale</h3>
          <p>
            Cloud QA tools typically charge per seat or per storage. For a large studio with 50+ QA staff 
            generating terabytes of video evidence, costs add up quickly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Self-hosted solutions have a higher initial setup cost but much lower marginal cost. 
            Storage is just hard drive space. Seats are just user accounts.
          </p>

          <h2>When Cloud Makes More Sense</h2>

          <p>
            Self-hosting isn't always the right choice. Cloud tools are better when:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>You're a small team.</strong> If you have 5 people, the overhead of managing servers isn't worth it.</li>
            <li><strong>You need rapid setup.</strong> Cloud tools work immediately. Self-hosted tools require configuration.</li>
            <li><strong>Your project isn't confidential.</strong> If you're making an indie game with no NDA, security concerns are minimal.</li>
            <li><strong>You lack IT resources.</strong> Someone needs to maintain self-hosted infrastructure. If you don't have that person, cloud is safer.</li>
            <li><strong>You need built-in integrations.</strong> Cloud tools often have deeper integrations with other cloud services.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Comparison: Self-Hosted vs Cloud QA Tools</h2>

          <table class="comparison-table">
            <thead>
              <tr>

          <h2>What to Look for in Self-Hosted QA Tools</h2>

          <h3>Easy Deployment</h3>
          <p>
            The best self-hosted tools offer Docker containers or simple installers. You shouldn't need 
            a week of configuration to get running. Look for tools that work with a single command.
          </p>

          <h3>Minimal Dependencies</h3>
          <p>
            Avoid tools that require complex stacks. If you need Kubernetes, Redis, Elasticsearch, 
            PostgreSQL, and three microservices just to track bugs, the maintenance burden is too high.
          </p>

          <h3>Standard Data Formats</h3>
          <p>
            Your bug reports and video evidence should be stored in formats you can access directly. 
            If you ever need to migrate or audit your data, you should be able to do so without 
            vendor-specific export tools.
          </p>

          <h3>Open Source Options</h3>
          <p>
            Open source self-hosted tools give you the most control. You can inspect the code, 
            modify it for your needs, and ensure there are no hidden data transmissions.
          </p>

          <div class="callout callout-blue">
            <p class="text-white font-semibold mb-2">What BugIt offers:</p>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-0">
              BugIt is a self-hosted QA dashboard (open source, MIT licensed) that stores bug reports 
              with frame-synced video, inputs, logs, and performance data. Single Docker container, 
              SQLite database, standard MP4 video files. Your data stays on your servers.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h2>Deployment Options</h2>

          <h3>On-Premise Servers</h3>
          <p>
            The most secure option. Hardware sits in your office, on your network, under your physical control. 
            Best for studios with strict security requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Trade-off: You're responsible for hardware maintenance, backups, and uptime.
          </p>

          <h3>Private Cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure)</h3>
          <p>
            Run self-hosted tools on virtual machines in a major cloud provider, but in a private VPC 
            that only your team can access. Good balance of control and convenience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Trade-off: Data is technically on someone else's hardware, but you control network access 
            and encryption.
          </p>

          <h3>Dedicated Hosting</h3>
          <p>
            Rent a physical server from a hosting provider. You get root access and full control, 
            but don't need to manage hardware.
          </p>
          <p>
            Trade-off: Monthly costs, and you're trusting the hosting provider's physical security.
          </p>

          <h2>Hybrid Approaches</h2>

          <p>
            Many studios use a hybrid approach:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Self-hosted for sensitive projects.</strong> Unannounced titles, licensed IP, console development.</li>
            <li><strong>Cloud for everything else.</strong> Internal tools, prototypes, jam games.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This gives you security where it matters without the overhead of self-hosting everything.
          </p>

          <h2>Making the Decision</h2>

          <p>
            Ask yourself these questions:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Do our contracts or NDAs restrict where data can be stored?</li>
            <li>Are we doing console development with devkit footage?</li>
            <li>Do we have someone who can maintain a server?</li>
            <li>How much video evidence will we generate per month?</li>
            <li>What's our budget for QA tooling?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you answered yes to the first two questions and yes to the third, self-hosting 
            is probably the right choice. If your team is small and your project isn't confidential, 
            cloud tools will be easier.
          </p>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>

          <p>
            Self-hosted QA tools aren't just for enterprises with dedicated IT teams. Modern self-hosted 
            solutions are simple enough that any studio can run them. The question is whether 
            the benefits (data control, compliance, network speed, cost) outweigh the overhead.
          </p>
          <p>
            For studios working on confidential projects, the answer is usually yes. Your bug reports 
            contain information about unreleased games. That information deserves the same security 
            as your source code.
          </p>
