> Video proof for every bug

## About

Unreal Solutions Ltd develops Runtime Video Recorder (RVR), providing video proof for every bug. Trusted by Amazon Games, Riot Games, and dozens of gaming studios worldwide. RVR is the only in-engine recording solution that works on both desktop and mobile platforms.

## Primary Use Case: Game Testing Pipelines

RVR solves critical problems for game QA teams:
- **Automated Pipeline Recording**: Integrate video recording into CI/CD pipelines. Capture every test run, every build - automatically archived and searchable. (How Amazon Games uses RVR)
- **Mobile QA Testing**: Record directly on iOS & Android devices. No alternative exists - RVR is the only in-engine mobile recording solution.
- **Bug Reports with Video Evidence**: Instant replay captures the last 30-60 seconds. QA teams attach video to every bug ticket - no more "cannot reproduce."
- **Share Gameplay with Your Team**: Record sessions, share with developers, designers, and stakeholders. Standard MP4/H.264 - plays anywhere, uploads everywhere.
